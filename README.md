Whimsical
The origins of my full name means "Gift of God, in the image of God, overseer" and the reason I was given my name was after the first book of the New Testament and the first man in the bible because I was my mother's first born son. I am a Cancer and Horse by the signs of the Greek and Chinese zodiacs, born on Mid-summer's Eve. The hour and minute of my birth is 17:38 at a military installation on which I later was stationed and served, coordinates N 47.10343 and W -122.54151. 135 is the score on the last Intelligence Quotient test I took, and the analysis stated I have superior pattern recognition and language skills. The two separate Military Occupational Specialties I held were 12B (Combat Engineer) and 13E (Cannon Fire Direction Control Specialist), and I was honorably discharged at the End of my Term of Service at the rank of Specialist. I take and post the results of many personality test, quizzes, and surveys in the blog section of this website. All of that is so you can auger more about me using whatever tool you feel comfortable using, whether psychology, statistical analysis, or some other preternatural mythos you may subscribe to.
